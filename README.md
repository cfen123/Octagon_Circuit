# Octagon_Circuit
For my circuits question on Brilliant. 
I wrote the scripts in Matlab for the purpose of solving for the currents in the circuit easily. I derived the systems of equations 
through the application of KVL and KCL to the non-overlapping loops and nodes respectively. 
For the equivalent resistance (Brilliant_Q.m), I derived a 
system of 17 equations with 17 variables. This resulted in a 17x17 matrix. The independent variable vector for this system 
is \(i,i_1,i_2,...,i_16\), where \(i\) is the current through the imaginary voltage source, i_1
